# ProptechEngine: Real-time Geospatial Analytics for Smart Building Energy Optimization

ProptechEngine is a cutting-edge open-source platform that leverages machine learning, IoT sensor fusion, and geospatial analytics to optimize energy consumption in smart buildings.

## Detailed Description

The ProptechEngine is designed to address the growing need for energy-efficient buildings by providing real-time insights into energy consumption patterns, usage trends, and optimization opportunities. By fusing data from various IoT sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and energy meters, with geospatial data, the platform creates a comprehensive understanding of building performance. This enables facilities managers, energy auditors, and building owners to make data-driven decisions to reduce energy waste, lower operating costs, and minimize environmental impact.

The ProptechEngine features a modular architecture that allows for seamless integration with existing building management systems (BMS) and IoT infrastructure. This enables a plug-and-play approach to energy optimization, reducing the complexity and cost associated with traditional energy management systems. The platform's advanced analytics capabilities, powered by machine learning algorithms, provide predictive insights into energy usage patterns, enabling proactive optimization and reducing the likelihood of energy waste.

The ProptechEngine offers a range of benefits, including:

* Real-time energy monitoring and analytics
* Predictive energy usage forecasting
* Automated energy optimization and control
* Integration with existing BMS and IoT infrastructure
* Scalable and modular architecture
* Cost-effective energy management solution

## Key Features

* Real-time geospatial analytics using PostGIS and GeoPandas
* IoT sensor fusion using MQTT and Apache Kafka
* Machine learning-based energy predictive modeling using scikit-learn and TensorFlow
* Integration with popular BMS platforms, such as BACnet and Modbus
* Support for various data formats, including CSV, JSON, and Avro
* Restful API for seamless integration with third-party applications

## Technology Stack

The ProptechEngine is built using a range of cutting-edge technologies, including:

* Python 3.9 as the primary programming language
* Flask as the web framework
* PostGIS and GeoPandas for geospatial analytics
* Apache Kafka and MQTT for IoT sensor fusion

## Installation

To install the ProptechEngine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/ProptechEngine.git`
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a new PostgreSQL database and update the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` environment variable
4. Run the database migration scripts using `flask db migrate` and `flask db upgrade`
5. Start the application using `flask run`

## Configuration

The ProptechEngine requires the following environment variables to be set:

* `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`: the URI for the PostgreSQL database
* `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`: the Kafka bootstrap servers for IoT sensor fusion
* `MQTT_BROKER_URL`: the MQTT broker URL for IoT sensor data ingestion
* `ML_MODEL_PATH`: the path to the trained machine learning model

## Usage

The ProptechEngine provides a Restful API for seamless integration with third-party applications. The API endpoints are:

* `POST /energy/data`: ingests energy consumption data from IoT sensors
* `GET /energy/analytics`: retrieves real-time energy analytics and predictive insights
* `PUT /energy/optimization`: triggers automated energy optimization and control

For example, to ingest energy consumption data from an IoT sensor, use the following curl command:
